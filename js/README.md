# Note about vec-la-fp

I use the vec-la-fp, with some extensions:

https://github.com/PubInv/vec-la-fp

I have submitted a pull request to Francis R. Stokes,
original author of [vec-la-fp](https://github.com/francisrstokes/vec-la-fp).

If this is accepted, I will change to use the official version of that project.
