# TriBalance Interactive GUI Elements

Because this is an interactive demo, please go to [https://pubinv.github.io/TriadBalance/TriadBalanceDemo.html](https://pubinv.github.io/TriadBalance/TriadBalanceDemo.html), which has an extensive demo and a <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/RobertLRead/o1vnfrh7/">JSFiddle</a>.

# Purpose and Status
<p>
This interactive page presents what may be a new graphical user interface element â€” the "triad-balance" diagram. The purpose is to use a
single click on a triangle to enter three values such as "Mind/Body/Sprit" or "Strength/Endurance/Flexibility" that are presumed to in some sense
be "in balance", or where it is interesting if they are in balance.
This diagram solves the fundamental problem of converting a point
on such a diagram into a 3-vector of values in a mathematically
consistent and invertible way.
The Triad Balance widget is fully responsive and stylable in css.
It should be easy for any javascript programmer to embed this on
a page. A full test suite and example code should assist in reuse.
