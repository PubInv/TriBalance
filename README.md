# Triad Balance Interactive, Respsonsive Diagram

Because this is an interactive demo, please go to [https://pubinv.github.io/TriadBalance/TriadBalanceDemo.html](https://pubinv.github.io/TriadBalance/TriadBalanceDemo.html), which has an extensive demo and a <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/RobertLRead/o1vnfrh7/">JSFiddle</a>.

# Purpose and Status
<p>
This interactive page presents what may be a new graphical user interface element â€” the "triad-balance" diagram. The purpose is to use a
single click on a triangle to enter three values such as "Mind/Body/Sprit" or "Strength/Endurance/Flexibility" that are presumed to in some sense
be "in balance", or where it is interesting if they are in balance.
This diagram solves the fundamental problem of converting a point
on such a diagram into a 3-vector of values in a mathematically
consistent and invertible way.
The Triad Balance widget is fully responsive and stylable in css.
It should be easy for any javascript programmer to embed this on
a page. A full test suite and example code should assist in reuse.
</p>

# Usage

To place an interactive diagram on your page:

Include the file ./dist/TriadBalance.js in your HTML.
Include the file ./dist/TriadBalance.css for styling.
Create an SVG element where you want the diagram.
Create a callback to receive the data when the diagram is clicked on.
In your JavaScript, create the initialization object from
your svg element and your callback. Other configuration is
possible, but defaults are given.

Call:
triadb.initialize_triad_diagrem(TBS);


# Development Usage

Mocha at present requires no other pacakges from NPM, though
it currently directly inlcludes a slight extension of vec-la-fp.

TriadBalance has mocha tests, and a browser-based test page.

To run the tests, install mocha

>  npm install --global mocha

Run mocha directly, or point your browser at the test file:
TriadBalanceTest.html.
